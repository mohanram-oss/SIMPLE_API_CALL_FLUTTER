First, I updated the PostDetailsScreen to display all the contents of the selected post. I did this by adding Text widgets to display the user ID and post ID fields. I also added labels above each field to make it clear what information is being displayed.

Next, I updated the layout of the PostListView to make it easier to read. I did this by using a ListView.separated widget instead of a ListView.builder widget. This allowed me to add separators between each post in the list, which makes it easier to distinguish between them.

I also added some padding to the PostListView to give it some breathing room, and I increased the font size of the post titles to make them more prominent.

Finally, I added a new onTap callback to the PostListView that navigates to the PostDetailsScreen when a post is tapped. This callback passes the selected post as a parameter to the PostDetailsScreen, which allows the screen to display all the contents of the selected post.

Overall, my goal was to make the app more user-friendly and easier to navigate. By displaying all the contents of the selected post on the PostDetailsScreen and using a ListView.separated widget for the PostListView.
